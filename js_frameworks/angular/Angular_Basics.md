# ANGULAR BASICS 

#### Angular Architecture Overview
- There are 5 basic building blocks to Angular
  - **Modules** are the main, high-level building block containing components, services and routes 
  - **Components** contains a template, data and logic (e.g. directives) and is part of a DOM tree and which contains subtree nodes
  - **Services** are generally the data layer and so make API requests
  - **Directives** are bound to an existing element (or inside a template) and attach behaviour, extend, or transform a particular element and its children 
  - **Routing** renders a component based on the URL state
